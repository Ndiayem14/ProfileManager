# **Profile Management Application**  

## **Overview**  
This is a simple GUI-based Profile Management Application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to enter and store their personal details (name, age, gender, and email) and retrieve them later using a keyword search.  

## **Features**  
- User-friendly graphical interface for profile creation.  
- Stores user information in a text file (`profiles.txt`).  
- Allows users to search and view saved profiles.  
- Includes unit tests for verifying profile storage functionality.  

## **Installation**  
Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).  
No additional libraries are required as the project uses built-in modules.  

## **Usage**  
1. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   python ui.py
   ```
2. Enter user details and click "Submit" to save.

3. Click "View" to search for saved profiles using a keyword.
## **Testing**
Run the unit tests to verify profile saving functionality:
  ```bash
  python unit_test_cases.py

```
## **Files Overview**
- ui.py → Main application with GUI implementation.

- unit_test_cases.py → Contains test cases for validating the save_profile function.

- profiles.txt → Stores saved profiles in a CSV-like format.
